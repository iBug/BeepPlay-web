# BeepPlay in React

This is a rework of my [original BeepPlay](https://github.com/iBug/CGadgets/tree/master/BeepPlay). Now created with React and works directly from your browser!

**Does not support IE** due to its lack of support for [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

Special thanks to @taoky and [taoky/beep-react](https://github.com/taoky/beep-react).
